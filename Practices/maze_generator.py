# MH 2nd maze practice

import turtle
import random

# six squares
# turtle goes sqaure by square and goes to every side of every square and randomly decides if that side will be white or black:
# turtle goes to square
# turtle decides if side 1 is white/black
# turtle goes to next side
# decides if side 2 is white or black
# turtle goes to next side
# turtle decides if side 3 
# turtle draws a border around all squares
# turtle draws line through maze- that is the correct path.
